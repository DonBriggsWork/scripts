# Scripts
## Overview
This repository contains a bunch of usefull scripts, mostly written in BASH. I have developed these scripts over the years to assist with everyday tasks. Some scripts have become outdated, or are not currently working. This is my scrap-paper repository where I put stuff that I am throwing together. I invite any willing geeks, or geekesses to colaborate with me.
