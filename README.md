# Scripts
## Summary
A bunch of usefull scripts, mostly written in BASH. I have developed these scripts over the years to assist with everyday tasks.
## Introduction
 This repository contains a bunch of useful scripts. They are mostly written in BASH. Some scripts have become outdated, or are not currently working. This is my scrap-paper repository where I put stuff that I am throwing together.

 I am transitioning to a more common-sense naming scheme for the scripts that I have written. The new script naming convention will GENERALLY follow one of twp patterns. They will be either: *noun-short_desc*, or *verb-short_desc*.
  
    - noun: General "thing" that the script operates on. (Ex. vpn, aws, key)
    - verb: General "thing" that the script does. (Ex. inst, init, backup)
    - short-desc: Short underscore seperated description
 
 I invite any willing geeks, or geekesses to colaborate with me.
